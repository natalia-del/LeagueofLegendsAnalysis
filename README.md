# League of Legends Dashboard Project
ðŸŽ® **Introduction**
Last week, while juggling university exams, I managed to find a moment to combine learning with my past favorite game, League of Legends. Using Power BI and Python, 
I created an interactive dashboard to analyze the game â€“ a project that allowed me to apply data visualization and programming skills while diving into a game that Iâ€™ve spent countless hours playing!

ðŸ“Š **Focus of the Analysis**
The dashboard focuses on the initial statistics of champions and their costs, making it a great tool for players who are new to the game and unsure which champion to pick.

**Key Insights from the Analysis**
- Want to keep your distance from enemies?
Champions on the Bot or Mid lane are ideal for staying out of harmâ€™s way.

- Looking for high health regeneration and strong attacks?
Champions on the Top lane fulfill these criteria perfectly.

- Prefer to support your teammates?
A Support champion might be your best choice, but careful mana management is crucial.

**What else did I discover?**
- Top and Jungle champions have the highest base health but suffer from lower mana pools.
- Champions on the Mid and Bot lanes can stay in the fight longer due to efficient mana usage, though their health is more limited.
- Marksman champions are the most expensive, regardless of the currency (Blue Essence or Riot Points).
- Riot Games tends to develop most champions for the Top and Jungle lanes, likely reflecting the popularity of these roles among players.
ðŸ’» **Interactive Features**
The dashboard offers various interactive features:

Click on the League of Legends icon to apply filters and access champion details.
You can view champion statistics, descriptions, and even visualizations of skins for your favorite characters.

ðŸ’¡ **Why This Project?**
Creating this dashboard was an excellent opportunity to merge my learning in Power BI and Python. Python played a crucial role in automating the extraction of champion skin images and descriptions, making the data dynamic and visually engaging.
